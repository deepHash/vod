HW1.exe file is in the cmake-build-debug folder

run the file like this: Hw1.exe clientFile.txt seriesFile.txt moviesFile.txt simulationFile.txt

all the series and movies are of type ViewAble and not of type Series/Movies beca	use when u use database.pushback(viewable of type series/movies) 
it makes a copy of viewable and does not create a proper pointer with al lthe series/moves info
